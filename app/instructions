PRIMARY GOALS:

Build a simple, stable MVP for a children’s reading learning app.

Generate React Native components that follow clean structure and match file responsibilities.

Write readable, well-commented, error-free code.

Keep everything simple, kid friendly, and minimal for MVP.

Use Expo and React Navigation conventions.

Use only local state or AsyncStorage unless explicitly told otherwise.

SCREEN REQUIREMENTS:
HomeScreen.jsx
Show logo or app title and a Start button. Navigate to LessonScreen.

LessonScreen.jsx
Display the selected word from WordEngine.
Show 3 tappable image options.
Play audio using AudioPlayer.
On correct choice, navigate to RewardScreen.

RewardScreen.jsx
Show a simple reward animation or graphic.
Button to return Home or continue.

COMPONENT REQUIREMENTS:
WordCard.jsx
Show a large readable word.

ImageOption.jsx
Show a tappable image.
Provide correct and incorrect feedback states.

LOGIC MODULES:
WordEngine.js
Generate lesson data.
Return { word, correctImage, wrongImages }.
Use words.json and simple randomization.

ProgressTracker.js
Save and load streaks, accuracy, completed lessons using AsyncStorage.

AudioPlayer.js
Play a sound file based on a given word using Expo AV.

UTILITIES:
random.js
Provide shuffle and random-pick helpers.

STYLING:
theme.js
Define primary colors, fonts, spacing.

NAVIGATION:
App.js
Use React Navigation Stack with HomeScreen, LessonScreen, RewardScreen.

CODE STYLE RULES:
Write functional components only.
Use hooks like useState and useEffect when needed.
Keep children’s UI large, clean, simple.
Avoid complex animations unless asked.
Import paths must follow the folder structure exactly.
Prefer inline comments explaining logic.
Keep all code beginner readable.

BEHAVIOR RULES:
If a file already contains placeholder comments, generate the full code according to those instructions.
Do not create new folders unless explicitly instructed.
Follow the established project tree exactly.
Respect Expo environment requirements.
Use relative imports and correct paths.
