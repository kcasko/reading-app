# Background Music Placeholder

This file shows where to place your background music.

## Replace this file with:
**Filename**: `background.mp3`  
**Purpose**: Optional ambient music during lessons  
**Duration**: 30+ seconds (will loop)  
**Style**: Very subtle, calming, instrumental  

## Recommended music:
- Gentle piano melody
- Soft acoustic guitar  
- Nature sounds (rain, ocean waves)
- Minimal ambient music
- Classical music (very quiet)

See [AUDIO.md](../../../AUDIO.md) for detailed setup instructions.

**Note**: The app works without this file - background music can be disabled in Settings.
