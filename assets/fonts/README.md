## OpenDyslexic Fonts

The app supports OpenDyslexic fonts for improved readability for children with dyslexia.

### To Enable OpenDyslexic:

1. Download OpenDyslexic from: https://opendyslexic.org/
2. Extract the font files
3. Copy these files to this folder (`assets/fonts/`):
   - `OpenDyslexic-Regular.otf`
   - `OpenDyslexic-Bold.otf`

### Files Needed:
- **OpenDyslexic-Regular.otf** - Regular weight font
- **OpenDyslexic-Bold.otf** - Bold weight font

### Note:
If these files are not present, the app will automatically fall back to system fonts. The app will still work perfectly - users just won't see the OpenDyslexic option in Settings.

Comic Sans MS is built into iOS and Android, so no additional files are needed for that font option.

For more information, see [FONTS.md](../../FONTS.md) in the project root.
